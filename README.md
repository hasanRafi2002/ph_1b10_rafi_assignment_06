## Key Requirements

### 1. **Navbar**

- Ensure it is responsive across Desktop, Tablet, and Mobile devices.
- The navbar should collapse into a mobile menu on smaller screens.

### 2. **Banner Section**

- Design the banner section as per Figma design.
- Include a "View More" button that, when clicked, scrolls down to the “Adopt Your Best Friend” section.
- Ensure the banner is fully responsive.

### 3. **Adopt Your Best Friend Section**

- **Left Side**:
  - Display 4 dynamic categories below the section title and subtitle, fetched from the provided API.
  - Add a "Sort By Price" button on the right, with a subtitle on the left, as per the design.
  - By default, show all available pets, with the active category styled according to Figma.
  - After clicking on a category, fetch and display pets from that category in a grid layout.
  - If no pets are available for a category, show a meaningful message.
  - Each card must display the following:
    - Thumbnail/Image
    - Pet Name
    - Breed
    - Birth Date
    - Gender
    - Price
    - Buttons: "Like", "Adopt", and "Details"
  - If any field is missing from the API response, handle it by displaying a placeholder or meaningful message.
- **Right Side**:
  - Clicking the "Like" button should add the pet's thumbnail to the right-side grid.
  - Display a 2-column layout for liked pet thumbnails.

### 4. **Modal Window**
